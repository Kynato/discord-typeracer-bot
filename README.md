# discord-typeracer-bot

Back-end is done and works as intended.                    
Discord does not seem to provide good enough interface                 
(or I am just bad)     
                                
Code is messy since I was trying everything to synchronise it with DC.            
Might come back to it later.                                      
Might just move it to PYGAME
